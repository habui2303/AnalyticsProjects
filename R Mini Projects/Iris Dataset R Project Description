This project involves analyzing a dataset to identify and address missing values (NAs) using statistical and non-ML methods. The process includes exploring the data, determining the extent of missingness, and applying appropriate strategies to handle NAs for both numerical and categorical features. 
Comparisons between the original and clean datasets will be performed using statistical summaries, graphical analyses, and bivariate trends to evaluate the impact of the chosen strategies. R code and concise explanations will support the findings throughout.
