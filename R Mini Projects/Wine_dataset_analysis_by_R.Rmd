This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

- The box plot indicates the diversity of outliers in this data set. Most of wine prices are concentrated within the interquartile range.

This suggests an opportunity to offer premium wine choices to customers looking for a luxurious option.","\n")

The dataset contains 13,090 wine products with diverse wine types, such as production years spanning from 1961 to 2020 and wine prices ranging from $3.55 to $3410.79.

cat("- When expanding their market, managers should carefully consider collaborations with wineries. Focus on wineries with a track record of producing highly rated wines (Average Rating >= 4.1) to ensure the quality of products. Additionally, target wineries with a significant number of ratings (Average Number of Ratings > 336) to tap into their established consumer base.","\n")
cat("- To attract a broader range of customers, managers should consider collaborating with wineries that offer a variety of wine types. This diversification caters to different consumer preferences and increases the chances of appealing to a wider audience.","\n")
cat("- Managers can implement a competitive pricing strategy by offering the diversity in wine prices. This involves offering both affordable and premium wines to meet the needs of various customer segments.","\n")
cat("- Managers should leverage the reputation and high ratings of selected wineries for marketing strategy. By highlighting the wineries' achievements and the quality of their wines, the company can attract potential customers.","\n")
cat("- Engaging with customers to gather feedback and reviews is also important for further strengthening the wineries' reputation and market presence. With the customers' feecback, we can improve product quality and based on those feedbacks to build a loyal customer database.","\n")
