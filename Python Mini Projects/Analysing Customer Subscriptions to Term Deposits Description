This project focuses on analyzing customer subscriptions to term deposits using train.csv and test.csv datasets. The goal is to identify patterns in the data, build predictive models, and evaluate their performance. 
The training dataset (train.csv) will be used to create models, while the test dataset (test.csv) will assess their predictive accuracy. Multiple models will be explored to determine the most effective approach for predicting customer subscription to term deposits. 
Key steps include data analysis,
