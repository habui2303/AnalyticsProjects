## Introduction

This repository serves as a hub for analytics projects that solve real-world problems, provide insights into datasets, and showcase data visualization techniques using different tools.

## Projects Overview

### Python Projects
These projects use Python for data analysis, visualization, and machine learning tasks. Major libraries include `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `scikit-learn`.

| Project File | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Credit_dataset_analysis_by_Python.py** | Analyzes a credit dataset to explore patterns in customer credit history, predict default risk, and visualize trends. |
| **Goodhealth&wellbeingDataset_NLPAnalysis_by_Python.py** | Natural language processing (NLP) analysis of text data related to health and well-being. Extracts insights from the dataset using Python. |
| **TwitterDataset_Natural_Language_Exploration_by_Python.py** | Explores and analyzes Twitter data using NLP techniques to understand trends and sentiment. |
