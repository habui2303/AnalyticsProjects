# Grace Bui - Data Analyst Portfolio
Welcome to my **GitHub Portfolio**!
I'm passionate about turning data into actionable insights. Here, you'll find a collection of analytics projects I've developed using  **Python**, **R**, **SQL**, **PowerBI** and **Tableau**. These projects reflect my experience in tackling real-world business problems through exploratory data analysis (EDA), predictive modeling, and interactive data visualization.

Feel free to explore my work—I’m always learning and excited to grow as a data professional!

You can use the editor on GitHub to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for
