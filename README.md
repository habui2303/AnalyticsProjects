# 📊 Grace Bui – Data Analyst Portfolio

Welcome to my **GitHub Portfolio**!

I’m passionate about turning data into actionable insights. My portfolio showcases analytics projects built using **Python**, **R**, **SQL**, **Power BI**, and **Tableau**. These projects reflect my experience in solving real-world business problems through **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, **predictive modeling**, and **interactive dashboards**.

Feel free to explore my work — I’m always learning and growing as a data professional!
